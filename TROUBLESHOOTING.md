# CPOS troubleshooting

Common issues across the **VS Code extension**, **browser companion**, and **terminal app**.  
If something isn’t listed here, open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/Soham109/cpos/issues) with your OS, CPOS versions, and the exact error text.

| Component | Version file |
| --- | --- |
| VS Code extension | `extensions/vscode/package.json` |
| Browser companion (Chrome) | `extensions/chrome/manifest.json` |
| Browser companion (Firefox) | `extensions/firefox/manifest.json` |
| Terminal app | `Cargo.toml` |

## VS Code — Run All fails: `spawn sh ENOENT`

**What it means:** CPOS could not start a shell to compile or run your file. This is **not** a wrong answer (WA) or compilation error (CE) in your solution.

**Fix:** Update to VS Code extension **0.3.21+** (uses `/bin/sh` on macOS/Linux and `cmd.exe` on Windows).

### macOS

1. Install a compiler if needed:
   ```bash
   brew install gcc
   ```
2. If VS Code was opened from the Dock (macOS), launch it from Terminal so PATH includes `/bin` and Homebrew:
   ```bash
   code .
   ```
3. Open **View → Output → CPOS** to see the exact command CPOS ran.

### Windows

1. Install a C++ toolchain — e.g. [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/):
   ```bash
   pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc
   ```
   Add `C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin` to your system **PATH** (or use MinGW-w64 / Scoop `gcc`).
2. **Python:** ensure `python` is on PATH (Windows often has no `python3` command).
3. Check **Output → CPOS** for the compile/run command and errors.

### Windows: `"Hello".exe` or Python `Invalid argument` / quotes in the path

**What it means:** CPOS was wrapping compile/run paths in extra quotes. MinGW then tried to create a file literally named `"Hello".exe`, and Python looked for a mangled path under `.cpos-vscode\build\`.

**Fix:** Update to VS Code extension **0.3.23+**.

### All platforms

- **CE in the panel** = the toolchain ran but the build failed — read stderr in the test row or CPOS output.
- Override commands: **Settings → Extensions → CPOS → Compile Commands** (`{source}`, `{output}`, `{dir}` placeholders).

## VS Code — Compilation errors (CE)

### macOS: `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` not found

Apple’s default `g++` is Clang and does not ship `bits/stdc++.h`. Install GNU g++:

```bash
brew install gcc
```

CPOS auto-detects Homebrew’s `g++-14`, `g++-15`, etc. when the GUI app’s PATH is thin.

### Custom compiler or flags

Sync with the terminal app via `~/Library/Application Support/cpos/config.toml` (macOS) or `%APPDATA%\cpos\config.toml` (Windows), or set `cpos.compileCommands` in VS Code settings.

## Submit — nothing happens or wrong language

### Submit does nothing

1. Install the [browser companion](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/gjnbapmjonegeeamdeahcoojgokeogmm) in **Chrome** (Edge/Brave work too), or load the Firefox companion from `extensions/firefox`.
2. Stay **logged in** to Codeforces or CSES in that browser.
3. CPOS talks to supported browser companions over `127.0.0.1`; Safari is not supported.
4. Keep the VS Code extension running (capture server on port `27122`).

### Codeforces submits with wrong compiler (e.g. C++17 instead of C++23)

Update the browser companion to **0.6.13+**. It picks the **newest matching compiler** from the submit dropdown (e.g. G++23 before G++17, or CSES C++21 before C++17) instead of a stale/hardcoded fallback.

Rebuild and upload from `extensions/chrome` if you install Chrome unpacked:

```bash
./package-store.sh
```

For Firefox source installs, pull the latest repo changes and reload `extensions/firefox/manifest.json` from `about:debugging`.

### Submit opens but code is empty or form not filled

- Log in on Codeforces/CSES in the same browser profile as the companion.
- Disable other extensions that might block scripting on judge pages.
- Retry after a full page load on the submit URL.

## Capture — samples or file not appearing

1. **VS Code:** open the folder where you want solution files before capturing.
2. **Browser companion** installed and enabled on `codeforces.com` / `cses.fi`.
3. **One CPOS server:** only one VS Code window should own the capture port (`27122`); the panel shows if another window is active.
4. Refresh the problem page after installing the extension.

Terminal app capture uses port `27121` — VS Code and TUI can both receive captures; VS Code is enough for most workflows.

---

## Terminal app — installer fails or `cpos` is not found

The recommended TUI install uses package managers backed by prebuilt GitHub Release binaries:

macOS/Linux with Homebrew:

```bash
brew tap Soham109/cpos https://github.com/Soham109/cpos
brew install cpos
```

Windows with Scoop:

```powershell
scoop bucket add cpos https://github.com/Soham109/cpos
scoop install cpos
```

### Homebrew: tap or install fails

Make sure Homebrew itself is healthy:

```bash
brew update
brew doctor
```

Then retry:

```bash
brew tap Soham109/cpos https://github.com/Soham109/cpos
brew install cpos
```

### Scoop: bucket or install fails

Make sure Scoop itself is healthy:

```powershell
scoop update
```

Then retry:

```powershell
scoop bucket add cpos https://github.com/Soham109/cpos
scoop install cpos
```

### Package file or release asset not found

Homebrew and Scoop depend on the generated `Formula/cpos.rb`, `bucket/cpos.json`, and GitHub Release assets. Cut a tagged release first, or use the installer fallback while developing:

macOS/Linux:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Soham109/cpos/main/install.sh | sh
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Soham109/cpos/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for the release and publishing flow.

## Terminal app — source install fails: `link.exe` not found

**What it means:** Rust on Windows is using the **MSVC** toolchain but **Visual C++ build tools** are not installed. VS Code does **not** include the linker.

This only applies when building CPOS from source with `cargo install`. The prebuilt installer above avoids this Rust/Windows setup issue.

### Fix A — MSVC (recommended on Windows)

1. Install [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/).
2. Select **Desktop development with C++** (or at least **MSVC** + **Windows SDK**).
3. Restart your terminal.
4. Retry:
   ```bash
   cargo install --git https://github.com/Soham109/cpos
   ```

**Verify:**

```bash
rustup show          # active toolchain, e.g. x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
where link.exe       # should find Visual Studio's linker
```

### Fix B — GNU toolchain (MSYS2)

1. Install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) and GCC:
   ```bash
   pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc
   ```
2. Switch Rust to the GNU target:
   ```bash
   rustup toolchain install stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
   rustup default stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
   ```
3. Retry `cargo install --git https://github.com/Soham109/cpos`.

### Don’t need the terminal app?

**VS Code extension + browser companion** is enough for capture, Run All, and submit. The TUI is optional (catalog, contests, analytics, recommendations).

---

## Terminal app — other issues

### Config location

| OS | Path |
| --- | --- |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/cpos/config.toml` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\cpos\config.toml` |
| Linux | `~/.config/cpos/config.toml` |

### Windows: the TUI shows garbled / Cyrillic ("Russian") text

Fixed in terminal app **0.1.6+** — CPOS now switches the Windows console to UTF-8 on startup. The cause was a legacy console code page decoding the UI's UTF-8 box-drawing/symbol characters as mojibake. Update with `cpos update` (or reinstall via Scoop). If you build from source, pull `main` and rebuild.

### Setup: pasting a template doesn't work / only the first line appears

Use terminal app **0.1.6+** and, on the Template step, press **`v`** to paste (CPOS reads the whole clipboard directly — reliable even where the terminal doesn't support bracketed paste, e.g. Windows conhost). Or press **`Tab`** to switch to **Upload** mode and load the template from a file path. This applies to all platforms; on macOS `⌘V` also still works.

### Submit from TUI opens wrong browser

The terminal app queues submit for the **browser companion** only (same as VS Code). Install a supported companion and use that browser while logged in.

### CSES progress not syncing

Set `cses_session` in config (see README) and use the browser companion on the CSES problem list.

---

## Panel UI

### Native theme — Run All button looks wrong on light VS Code themes

Update to VS Code extension **0.3.20+**. Native theme uses VS Code button colors (white label on the theme button background).

### Extension README screenshot broken in Extensions view

Update to **0.3.20+** or reinstall from the latest VSIX/Marketplace build.

---

## Still stuck?

1. Note your versions (VS Code extension, browser companion, terminal app if used).
2. Copy the **full error** from **Output → CPOS** or your terminal.
3. Say which step failed: TUI install, capture, Run All, submit, or source install.
4. [Open an issue](https://github.com/Soham109/cpos/issues) or ask in your community with that info.
